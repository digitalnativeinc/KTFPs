## Summary

Polkadot has launched with its massive and probably the most decentralized features for web3.0, but people just do not understand what it is as a whole. Polkadot introduced a new address scheme that accomodates both EVM and WASM, but building teams get complaints from thousands of users losing their fund due to inconsistent address conversion when they move their funds from CEX to each dapp. Polkadot has treasury and democracy module to show probably the most decentralized governance system, but people just do not have what to vote for as they cannot find its purpose as they just do not know how to use it. Polkadot has all the ingredients and objectives to the decentralization of the web3.0 (A->B->C), but Users like mothers and fathers cannot follow the evolution when they are the majority part of the global population without gigabrains(attention dying in A). From one of Polkadot's building team perspective who faces these complaints from telegram every time, we collect all the hardships and UX problems and make aggregated interface for all polkadot ecosystem in an app just like fintech startups do for their outdated fiat finance. Starting with transfers, the app will grow with community solving their hardship, and proceed when they feel it is comfortable with each task to fully operate web3.0 in Polkadot. Unlike other wallets trying to support Polkadot's grand vision of Web3.0 by supporting plain module functions, this wallet app focuses on how to really use Polkadot such as transferring tokens safely from CEX to dapps without guides, or how to buy nfts from polkadot parachains without documentations, etc.
